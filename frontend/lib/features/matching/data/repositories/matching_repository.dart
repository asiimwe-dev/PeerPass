/// Every method throws a [Failure], never a transport exception and never a
/// `FormatException`. Translating `DioException`, problem documents, and

/// renders a message and never has to know whether the API answered with a socket
/// error, a 422, or a body that was not the shape it documents.
///
/// Now holding help requests as well, because a request is how a student asks to
/// be matched: without [createHelpRequest] and [selectTutor] the list this feature
/// shows is a list nobody can act on.
///
/// Narrow on purpose in one direction. Confirming -- the tutor accepting, which
/// creates a session -- is not here. A session belongs to the sessions feature and
/// its repository owns creating one, so a confirm from this side would be two
/// features writing one endpoint and two answers to "who may confirm this".
