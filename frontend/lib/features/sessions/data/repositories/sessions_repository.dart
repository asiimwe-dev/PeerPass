/// The tutoring-session contract the screens depend on.

/// Every method throws a [Failure], never a transport exception and never a
/// `FormatException`. Translating `DioException`, problem documents, and
/// unparseable bodies into [Failure] happens in the implementation, so a screen
/// renders a message and never has to know whether the API answered with a socket
/// error, a 400, or a body that was not the shape it documents.
///
/// Deliberately narrow. Session cancellation and the tutor rating summary are
/// the API's but have no screen in this release: cancellation needs a reason from
/// the user and its own confirmation journey, and a tutor's rating summary is a
/// separate screen about their own record rather than one of these. Adding either
/// is a screen first and a method second.

  /// names the caller and is waiting on an answer, so a tutor cannot open a
  /// session against work nobody asked them for, and cannot confirm a second
  /// request the student never chose them for.
  ///
  /// [topic] and [courseUnitId] are what the request already says, passed
  /// through rather than re-derived. The API checks the unit against the request
  /// and refuses a mismatch, and it is the only place that answer can be trusted,
  /// so a client that put its own unit here would be refused rather than believed.
  ///
  /// A request the student has since abandoned, or that another confirmation
  /// already took, comes back as a `ConflictFailure`. A lost race is a conflict
  /// and not a crash: the session is created by a unique constraint on the
  /// request, and two taps on a phone produce two requests for one answer.

  ///

  /// that the tutor actually covered those units, as separate from the score. It
  /// is optional and empty by default on purpose -- an empty list is a legitimate
  /// submission, and a client that could not express it would push people into
  /// endorsing to get past a form. The API accepts only the session's own course
  /// unit and refuses anything else, so this is the unit the session was booked
