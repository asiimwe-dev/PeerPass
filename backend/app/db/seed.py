"""Reference data for the pilot institution.

Run it with `python -m app.db.seed`. Idempotent, so it is safe to re-run after a
migration.

The pilot is a single institution, so the seed holds a single university. It is
not filler: the onboarding wizard's pickers read these rows, and an empty
catalogue would leave those screens with nothing to show.

This is not a migration. Migrations move a schema between versions and are
written by hand; this fills tables whose contents are reference data, using the
tables the migrations already created.

UNIVERSITY_NAME = "Mbarara University of Science and Technology"

#: MUST's undergraduate scale is a five-point scale, not a percentage one, and
#: the difference is load-bearing. A tutor's standing is stored as points, so a
#: percentage figure would put the number in the wrong unit twice over: in the
#: column, and in the comparison the matching engine makes.
SCALE_NAME = "MUST Undergraduate (5-point)"

#: The published maximum. `grades.max_points` is denormalised from this, which is
#: why a scale's maximum is treated as write-once once seeded.
MAX_POINTS = Decimal("5.00")

#: B+ is worth 4 points and is the bar a tutor must clear.
#:
#: Stored as data rather than as a constant in the matching code because the bar
#: belongs to the institution, not to the product. The next university added will
#: have its own, and changing one must not change another's.
#:
#: On MUST's published bands this is 65%, so B+ and everything above it
#: qualifies and B, at 55-64%, does not.
COMPETENCY_MIN_POINTS = Decimal("4.50")

#: A through D, best first.
#:
#: F is deliberately absent. `grades` carries a `grade_points > 0` check and F is
#: worth zero, so it cannot be represented on this scale without relaxing a
#: constraint the schema relies on. It is also not needed: a student's result is
#: a `Competency`, which asserts competence, and nobody claims competence with a
#: fail. Representing F belongs with transcript display, if that is ever built.
