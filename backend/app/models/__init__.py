"""SQLAlchemy persistence models.

Every model is imported here so that Alembic's autogenerate and the test
fixture's `create_all` see the complete metadata. A model that is not reachable
from this module does not exist as far as migrations are concerned, and the
resulting "missing table" surfaces at runtime rather than at review.
