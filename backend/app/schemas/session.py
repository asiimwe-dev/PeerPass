"""Help request and session schemas.

A request is what a student asks for; a session is what happened. They are
separate resources on the wire as well as in the database, because a request can
sit unmatched or be withdrawn and must not appear as a session that never
occurred.

Status is never accepted from a client. A request or a session moves through
`status`, and the only field a client may set is the one its own action implies:
`cancelled_reason` and `cancelled_by` are recorded by the service from the
caller, because a client that can set them would let one user cancel another's
session and blame them.
