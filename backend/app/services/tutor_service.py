"""Tutor discovery: the rail a student browses, and one tutor's public profile.

Both entry points are read-only and both are student-facing, which fixes two
things they may never do.

They may not create a `TutorProfile`. A row exists for a user holding the tutor
role and is created when the role is granted, in `validation_service`. A browse
that minted one would hand every signed-in student a `probationary` standing and
zero counters merely by opening the discovery screen -- which is exactly the bug
`rating_service.get_tutor_rating_summary` was fixed for. Nothing here writes, and
`tests/test_tutor_rail.py` asserts the row count is unchanged after every `GET`.

They may not show a suspended tutor. `SUSPENDED` is excluded from the rail in
the query rather than filtered out afterwards, so a suspended tutor cannot reach
a student-facing list even if a later filter is added above it. The detail
screen is the deliberate exception: a student who already booked that tutor has
to be able to see that the standing is `suspended`, and
`TutorProfileSummary` says so.

This is a discovery surface, not matching. It answers "who is strong here",
where `matching_service` answers "who may take this request". They share the
competency gate -- a verified grade at or above the scale's
`competency_min_points`, which is invariant 1 -- and nothing else. The rail does
not widen to a subject, does not rank by a session's proximity, and does not
consult availability: it is a browsable shortlist, and matching remains the only
place a tutor is proposed for work.
