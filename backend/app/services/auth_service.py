"""Authentication: registration, sign-in, refresh rotation, and sign-out.

This is the first module in `app.services` to hold real logic, so it sets the
pattern for the others. The rules it exists to enforce, and where each comes
from, are in `docs/architecture.md` section 9. The short version:

- A password is checked against a stored Argon2id hash, and a sign-in for an
  unknown email spends the same Argon2 work as one for a wrong password, so the
  endpoint cannot be used to discover which addresses have accounts.
- Refresh tokens are opaque, stored only as a peppered HMAC, and rotated on
  every use. Presenting one that was already rotated is treated as theft and
  kills the chain.
- Every failure a caller can provoke is indistinguishable from every other
  failure a caller can provoke.

`app.core.security` provides the primitives. Nothing here re-implements one, and
nothing here decides a password policy -- `app.core.password_policy` owns that.
