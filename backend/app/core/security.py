#: OWASP's recommended Argon2id floor: 19 MiB, two passes, one lane.
#:
#: Argon2 is memory-hard, which is the point: it removes the parallelism that
#: makes GPU and ASIC cracking cheap against PBKDF2. The previous choice,
#: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at 600k iterations, was chosen when a compiled dependency
#: was a genuine operational cost. That reason has expired --
#: `argon2-cffi-bindings` publishes a single `abi3` wheel covering CPython
#: 3.10 through 3.15 on manylinux x86_64 and aarch64, macOS arm64, and Windows,
#: so there is no per-platform build step any more.
#:
#: These sit at the floor rather than above it because the pilot runs on a small
#: instance, and Argon2's cost is paid in resident memory per concurrent
#: verification rather than in CPU time. Raising the floor is not a migration:
#: every hash records the parameters it was made with, and
#: `password_needs_rehash` upgrades a stored hash on its owner's next
#: successful sign-in. Change the settings, and the fleet catches up on its own.
#:
#: Because the cost is memory rather than time, the ceiling on concurrent
#: verifications is a RAM calculation, not a CPU one. The rate limiter in
#: `app.core.rate_limit` has to respect it, or a burst of sign-in attempts
#: becomes an out-of-memory kill rather than a slow response.
