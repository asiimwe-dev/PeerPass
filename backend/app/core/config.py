"""Application configuration.

Every value that differs between a developer's machine, CI, and a deployment
arrives from the environment. Nothing here has a default that would let the
service start in a state nobody intended: a missing database URL, a missing
signing key, or a missing token pepper is a startup failure, not a warning,
because an API that boots without a signing key will happily issue tokens
nobody can revoke, and one that boots without a pepper can be checked offline
against a stolen database.

Three separate secrets, deliberately:

- `jwt_secret` signs tokens. Rotating it signs every user out unless the old
  key is kept in `jwt_previous_secrets`.
- `token_pepper` hashes refresh and verification tokens. Rotating it also signs
  every user out, because no stored hash matches afterwards.
- `database_url` frequently embeds its own credentials.

Collapsing any two of them into one would mean one rotation takes out two
independent protections at the same time.
