"""The student chooses a tutor; that tutor confirms or declines.

MVP decision 3 says the tutee picks from a short list, and that the tutor then
answers. Two halves of that are asserted here, and the second is the one that is
easy to leave out.

The student may only choose from tutors the engine would propose. The service
re-derives the candidate list rather than trusting the id in the body, because a
request body is whatever the caller chose to send -- an id that once appeared in
a list the client holds proves nothing about the tutor's competency, grade or
standing at the moment of the request. Every refusal case below is built so the
tutor is *almost* eligible, which is what makes the gate the reason for the
answer rather than an accident of the fixture.

The tutor may only confirm the request that named them. A session could be
created by any tutor against any unselected request before this change, which set
`matched_tutor_id` to the caller and never asked the student -- the exact inverse
of the decision, and the one place a tutor could take work a student had refused
them.

The service tests call the services, because a rule reachable only through a
router is a rule nobody can read. The wire tests go through the real router with
real tokens, because the route ordering, the auth guard, and the status codes are
only observable there.
