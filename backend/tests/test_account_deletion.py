"""Account deletion, and what it is required to leave behind.

The product decision is anonymisation, not removal. Every FK to `users.id`
cascades, so a `DELETE` on the row would take the sessions, ratings, endorsements
and competencies with it -- and a `Session` is the source of truth for a tutor's
`certified_minutes`, so removing the row would silently rewrite a colleague's
certificate progress. The tests below therefore assert two things that pull in
opposite directions, and both have to hold:

    the identity goes, and the evidence stays.

Most of this file goes through the real router with a real access token. A
deletion that anonymises the row correctly but leaves `get_current_user` willing
to authenticate it passes every service-level test and ships an account that was
asked to stop existing and can still read the API with a token minted beforehand.
That is the failure this file exists to catch.
