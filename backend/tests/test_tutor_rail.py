"""The tutor discovery rail, and one tutor's public profile.

Two different things are tested here and neither substitutes for the other.

The rules -- who may appear in a student-facing list at all -- are domain rules
about who holds a standing and a verified grade, and they are worth asserting
directly.

The wire contract is worth as much, and most of this file therefore goes through
the real router with real access tokens. A service that filters correctly, behind
a route wired without an auth guard or pointed at the wrong schema, passes every
service-level test and ships a directory of the whole university.

The last group is the regression that bit us: no `GET` may create a
`TutorProfile`. `TutorProfile` rows belong to users holding the tutor role and
are created when the role is granted, so a browse that minted one would hand
every signed-in student a `probationary` standing merely by opening the
discovery screen.
