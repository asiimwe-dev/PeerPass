"""Matching: who the platform is willing to propose, and why not the others.

Two layers, deliberately. The service tests state the gate as a rule -- this
grade is in, that one is out, this standing is proposed -- and they call the
service directly, because a rule reachable only through a router is a rule
nobody can read.

The wire tests go through the real router with a real token, because two of the
defects this file now covers are invisible to a service test. One handler was
registered at two URLs, so which one a client reached depended on the base URL
it was configured with. And the request-backed route answered for whichever
course unit the *body* carried, ignoring the request in its own path -- a tutor
who could help with something else entirely was the answer to "who can take
this request". Both look correct from the service, which is the point of
asserting them over HTTP.
