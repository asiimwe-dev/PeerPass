"""The auth slice, exercised through the real router.

Every test here goes through HTTP. A unit test on `auth_service` with a hand-built
session would pass while the route, the dependency wiring, or the problem-document
envelope was broken -- and those are the parts the client actually depends on.

The tests that matter most are the ones that would fail quietly. Enumeration,
refresh rotation, and family revocation are security properties with no
user-visible symptom when they break, so they are asserted explicitly rather than
left to be covered incidentally.
